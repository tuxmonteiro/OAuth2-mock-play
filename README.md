# OAuth2 Mock Play Server

OAuth2 Mock Play Server is an implementation of an OAuth2 server for mocking/testing. It's designed to be configurable by environment variables (by use of the Typesafe config), so it's easy to configure the mock to suit your application's needs. With OAuth2 Mock Play Server, all you have to do is run the server and configure your application's OAuth2 endpoints to the mock server. 

## Project Intro

OAuth2 Mock Play Server exists out of necessity: The project author searched for an easily configurable, open-source OAuth2 mock server that supported all of the different login flows specified by the OAuth2 specification, and didn't find one. With that in mind, you might also find this project useful, especially if you're creating a web application gated by an OAuth login and need testing and local development support. Typically, you have to explicitly code a flag to disable OAuth2 in your application, or use a production OAuth2 server and deal with port forwarding, reverse proxying, and generating fake certificates to get redirects working.

You can also use OAuth2 Mock Play Server as a replacement for creating mocks physically in your code while running tests.
First, set `OAUTH2_DISABLE_CONSENT=true`. Then run the server and configure your web application to point the mock OAuth2 server while your tests run.

## To-Do
- [x] Add an option to disable all consent screens (handy for tests that run against the mock server)
- [ ] Add some very specific configurations—for example, disabling `client_secret` checks (not all OAuth2 servers use this)
- [ ] Write tests
- [x] Create a Docker image
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Add a Swagger spec for documentation
- [ ] Add logging

## Running the Server via Play

* Load dependencies via `sbt update`
* Run via `sbt ~run`
* Point your web application OAuth2 endpoints against [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). See
[routes](https://github.com/zalando/OAuth2-mock-play/blob/master/conf/routes) for info on the routes and
[application.conf](https://github.com/zalando/OAuth2-mock-play/blob/master/conf/application.conf) for guidance on how the
configuration works

Note that you might need to disable secure cookies in your web application for this to work, because the server
is running over standard HTTP rather than HTTPS.

## Docker Image

The project is currently deployed via the Zalando open source write endpoint
`registry-write.opensource.zalan.do/opensource/oauth2-mock-play:1.0.3`. However, the read/pull endpoint is without `-write`— namely, `registry.opensource.zalan.do/opensource/oauth2-mock-play:1.0.3`.

To run the Docker image, do:

```sh
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 registry.opensource.zalan.do/opensource/oauth2-mock-play:1.0.3
```

# Development

## Code Formatting

The project is formatted with [scalafmt](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt). Please make sure you run
scalafmt in sbt before you make a commit.
